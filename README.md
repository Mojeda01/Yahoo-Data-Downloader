# Yahoo Finance Stock Data Downloader

This Python script downloads daily stock price history for a given stock symbol using Yahoo Finance and saves it as a CSV file in the current directory. This little script could work if Yahoo would relax on their rate-limiting.... But ohh well.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **requests** library
- **pandas** library
